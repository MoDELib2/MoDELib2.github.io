![Giacomo Po](/images/HeadShot.png)

**Giacomo Po** joined the University of Miami College of Engineering’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering as an assistant professor. A leader in computational mechanics of materials, he developed novel tools to predict the microstructural evolution of high-temperature and high-strength materials such as refractory metals and ceramics.

Prior to joining the College, Po was a research scientist at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), where he has published more than 40 peer-reviewed journal articles in the area of defects mechanics in crystals. Po received his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Bologna, Italy, and his master’s in mechanical engineering and PhD in structural and solid mechanics at UCLA.
